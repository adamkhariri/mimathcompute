Hi! I'm Adam Fahmi Khariri, a passionate data analyst with a keen interest in exploring the possibilities of statistics and machine learning. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and build creative solutions.

## Featured Projects

* **Soybean Leaf Disease Classification using SVM:** A detection program to detect Soybean leaf that infected by disease built with Python. This project allowed me to delve into Classification and implement SVM (Support Vector Machine). (See svm_soybean_leaf_disease.py or svm_soybean_leaf_disease_cm.ipynb)
* **Football (soccer) player transfer suitability:** A statistical approach for player suitability. This research is still on update (See pacho.r)
